 <h1>Skillsets</h1>
 
<h2>Analytical Mindset.</h2> <h4>This is, without question, the most important skill an analyst can 
possess. Without the innate curiosity in and pursuit of the “huh … that’s weird,” an analyst 
can have all the data in the world but they will inevitably find themselves missing pieces 
of the puzzle. The analyst needs to be able to make reasoned assumptions and chart a 
new course when the trail runs cold.</h4></br>
 <h2>Log Analysis.</h2> <h4>Logs from services and devices are just a couple of the most important 
and underutilized sources of intelligence for any security department. The ability to 
analyze logs for anomalies and pivot between data sources to see the big picture is a key 
competency.</h4></br>
 <h1>Network Forensics.</h1> The ability to read and understand packet capture data and 
determine the malicious nature of network traffic. If you’re fortunate enough to extend 
your NSM capabilities to the endpoint with an EDR product, a sound foundation in host 
based forensics is key to compliment your network knowledge.

 <h1>Network Architecture.</h1> An understanding of different network devices and how they 
operate within the environment
